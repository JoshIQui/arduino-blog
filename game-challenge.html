        <p class="has-text-white">This game will involve a dancing toy that has a way to increase the duration of the dance. It will also require a toaster that has been preferably modified to not generate any heat or be dangeous to touch. The game involves taking turns winding up a dancing toy and handing it between players. Once the toy has finished dancing, the toaster will activate and launch out a small ceremonious item. Once this has happened, that player is eliminated. The strategy for this game is to wind enough to ensure that the players that come after you might have the toaster activate while they are holding the toy. The last player left in the game is considered the winner.</p>
